    "Imagine that you wish to exchange one currency for another. You realize that instead of directly exchanging one currency for another, you might be better off making a series of trades through other currencies, winding up with the currency you want. Suppose that you can trade n different currencies, numbered 1,2,… ,n, where you start with currency 1 and wish to wind up with currency n. You are given, for each pair of currencies i and j , an exchange rate rij , meaning that if you start with d units of currency i , you can trade for drij units of currency j.\n",
    "1. Assuming there is no commission, write python code to solve this problem.\n",
    "2. Look up the exchange rates for 3-4 currencies online. What solution does your code find?\n",

In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row, removes it from the row permanently, and receives the value of the coin. Determine the maximum possible amount of money we can definitely win if we move first.\n",
